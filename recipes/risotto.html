        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Risotto is one of the italian way of saying <em>juicy, delicious, beautiful</em> rice stew. Is the easy-to-make plate you can showoff with the one you love or just enjoy eating it <del>from the saucepan</del> however you like.</p>
        <p>The most fun about this plate is that you can combine it with any topping of your preference. You are on the meat side, try it with leeks in it and a juicy steak on top. Fancy seafood? Try shrimps and calamari. Vegetarian is no problem either, try it with mushrooms!</p>
        <p>For this recipe we will try <strong>mushroom risotto.</strong></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth (you can use chicken or any broth of your preference)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2/3 portobello mushrooms (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>2/3 white mushrooms (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>1 1/3 shallots (diced)</li>
            <li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chives (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 3/4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 1/2 tablespoons parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.</li>
            <li>Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet, and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
