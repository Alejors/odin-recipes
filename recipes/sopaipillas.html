        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chilean sopaipillas are what one might think as a savory hotcake, made with squash and deep-fried. They are really common during winter season, but over the past decade people have began eating them throughout the year since they are great with virtually any topping. They are frequently sold on the streets and eaten with mustard, but homewise they can be eaten with "chancaca" (typical chilean homemade caramel).</p>
